### Tasks of each group member

**Pedro Inácio** (NPC, dialogue classes and UI, level design)

**Catarina Matias** (TicketTimer, Camera & Player Movement, in-Engine Animations, player-UI canvas, level design)

Responsible for the `TicketTimer` and `Player` classes. Was responsible for the incorporation of the code given in DJD classes in this project and it's adaptation to the current project. Regular tasks included level design and code updating, along with code support to the team and fixes.

Work especially focussed on the "visual" component, such as creation of assets, like the crosshair and its associated code, and the visual language used throughout in the 3D models and materials.

### Describing Solution approach

Blue Light is about the conflict of thought within a society. Two opposing sides try to bring a Neutral born child to their Faction through a series of interviews, introducing them to their ideals and values. The child - the Player - must decide for themselves which side they will be on.

On one side, there's the Order Faction, which values total equality and integration of the member in their society. Order member share a hive-mind and there is no individuality, for true equal-ness only happens if everyone is the same.

The other side of the coin is represented by the Freedom Faction, who believe that one should be themselves at all times. They have distinguishing personalities and, from mild to explosive, like to assert their ideas and manifest themselves.

When transposing these concepts to Unity, a priority was the dialogue system - developed by Pedro - as it allowed for the player to experience our idea and be introduced more and more to an imperfect and extreme world. Meanwhile, Catarina and Afonso focused on the script and level design to incorporate the dialogue on.

As for the visual component, Catarina was focussed more here, making the visual assets and the user UI, on the `Canvas` class.

Afonso focussed on the level design and programmed the `Menu` classes, along with their scenes. When pressing `ESC`, the player can exit to either the Start Menu and restart the game, or leave for the Desktop.
