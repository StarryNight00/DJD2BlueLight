Responsible for the `TicketTimer` and `Player` classes. Was responsible for the incorporation of the code given in DJD classes in this project and it's adaptation to the current project. Regular tasks included level design and code updating, along with code support to the team and fixes.

Work especially focussed on the "visual" component, such as creation of assets, like the crosshair and its associated code, and the visual language used throughout in the 3D models and materials.
